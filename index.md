# Site ABSTRACT & DESCRIPTION #

## Abstract ##
These days since electronic components price has dropped, unmanned systems and many of electronic stuff become more and more popular.
The main purpose of this site is to offer a complete management for any electronic stuff being connected to the internet for home automation systems, as well as hobby Unmanned Aerial/Ground Vehicles or Industrial Automation Systems, mainly for hobby and non commercial use.
The inspiration and goals of this site has rised from the hobby needs appearing in many discussion forums as: “We wish to drive it over internet in realtime”.

The first result of our work was encouraging and many functions can be used by professionals as well.

Let’s call everything able to connect as:
  * “Device” for non moving stuff
  * “Drone” moving stuff
Drones & Devices are both Open Source and Commercial HW.

**Who can benefit from our services?**
  1. any hitech lovers
  1. anyone having robots, drones and any device able to connect the internet
  1. hobbiest & professionals for online Configuration and Command&Monitor their stuff
  1. family for children tracking
  1. control the car possition

**Main Functions**
  1. Device and Drones Database **_(Completed)_**
  1. GPS Tracking               **_(Completed)_**
  1. GPS Route planning         **_(Completed)_**
  1. Data Stream warehouse      **_(Finalising)_**
  1. Command&Monitor            **_(Developpment)_**

**Which Devices and Drones can any hobbiest connect easily now?**
  * Arduino and Arduino compatible and similar [(More here)](http://arduino.cc/playground/Main/SimilarBoards)
  * FEZ Domino, FEZ Cobra, FEZ Panda... [(More here)](http://www.tinyclr.com/hardware)
Let’s start the battle between them.
